        Hi, I am Paul Dilley, a frontend web developer of 10 years in Toronto, originally from the UK! My experience is with React, AngularJS
        and ExtJS, and my current adventures have also taken me into mobile app development using Cordova, React Native and Flutter!
        <br /><br />
        I started programming when I was about 10 years old, building Javascript based plugins for forum BB boards.
        From there, I worked on a rich text editor that could style itself according to the "BB code" that was typed
        - I learned to love Regular Expressions! I'm also somewhat skilled with CSS and producing UI's according to mockups!
        Later I moved to Canada, where I have worked full-time at Basis, Ticko and Instacart.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of programming, I like to travel, read about science, cook, go on long walks and cycle.
      </p>
